## About The Project

Based on the [React tic tac toe tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) in the official React documentations page as a part of the Microverse curriculum.

The following are actions that can be done on the application.
  1. Lets you play the game.
  2. Indicates when a player has won the game.
  3. Stores a game’s history as a game progresses.
  4. Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.
